# Audio signal processing project

This Github page contains the report and the code for the Tampere University signal.120 course. 
The audio files used to train, validate and test the model are not included, but the results are visible in the Jupyter notebook file.

This project really helped me to understand how machine learning models are trained and tested, and how difficult it can be to choose the training parameters and data.
